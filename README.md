### Introducing a Dataset <a name="dataset-introduction"></a>
This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

### Data Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions and wrangling process. There are 3 data files used to address the above qustions
1. portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
2. profile.json - demographic data for each customer
3. transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

### Project Motivation <a name="project-motivation"></a>
I chose this project to understand the success rate of offers being sent and analysis is done through addressing the following questions.
1. See if we can predict if a specific offer would be successful based on offer and customers data?
2. What's the performance level of an offer?
